<p>Is makeup remover something to get excited about? Some would say no. But for   others, happening upon a remover that is soothing, non-irritating, and effective   at eliminating any trace of even the most stubborn makeup (three words: fuchsia   lip stain), is a joyous occasion indeed. Chic French pharmacopeia brand <a href="http://www.klorane.com/public/klorane/html/toolkit/flash/index.php">Klorane</a> has been making what is, in our humble opinion, the best eye makeup remover for   over thirty years, and now (at last!) they have tweaked the formula to work the   same magic on the face. Arriving at <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/beauty.asp?catid=9730">beauty.com</a> on August   1, Klorane¡¯s new Soothing Make-Up Remover Water stars the same cornflower   extract¡ªprized for its ability to calm, purify, and decongest¡ªas its predecessor   in a six-ingredient formula that is paraben, alcohol, and fragrance-free.   Besides serving as a reliable cosmetics dissolver, it also cleanses and tones   the skin, and since the base is water, not oil, you won¡¯t feel the need to rinse   afterward, which makes this the perfect panacea for those nights when general   grogginess or slight drunkenness simply won¡¯t allow for more than one   skin-cleansing step. (You know exactly what we mean.)<br />

<p>Lovers of <a href="http://www.apc.fr">APC¡¯s</a> raw denim face an interesting   predicament. If you¡¯re not supposed to put the jeans in the washing machine,   how, exactly, do you keep them clean? Until now, the Mercer Street boutique   sales team has always recommended dry-cleaning. That, and placing soiled pants   in a Ziploc bag in the freezer overnight to kill any unpleasant odors. But come   September, there will be another way beat the dirt and grime: APC¡¯s first-ever   Fine Fabric Care cleanser. Created in conjunction with chemists from <a href="http://www.aesop.net.au/">Aesop</a>, the Australian hair and body care   line known for its plant-based formulas, the petitgrain, lemon, and   cedarwood-scented soap was designed specifically for hand-washing garments,   like, say, those jeans you¡¯ve been wearing through the summer humidity. Other   delicate items will also benefit from the cleanser¡¯s gentle touch, but if you¡¯re   more psyched about its ability to freshen up your everyday denim, simply heed   these washing instructions from APC founder Jean Touitou:</p>
<p>1) Put two soup spoons of cleanser in a bath tub half filled with hot water,   but the water must not be so hot that it burns your hands.</p>
<p>2) Let your jeans soak for a while.</p>
<p>3) Swish around, give a twist.</p>
<p>4) Rinse and hang to dry (a dryer is to be avoided at all costs!).<br />
